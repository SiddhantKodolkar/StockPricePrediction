Recurrent neural networks are a type of long short term memory. The output from the previous phase is sent into the current step of an RNN as input. Hochreiter & Schmidhuber created LSTM. It addressed the issue of long-term RNN dependency, in which the RNN can predict words from current data but cannot predict words held in long-term memory. RNN's performance becomes less effective as the gap length increases. By default, LSTM can save the data for a very long time. It is utilised for time-series data processing, forecasting, and classification.
